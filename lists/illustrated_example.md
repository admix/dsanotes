# Illustrated Example

When writing the code for a linked list, you must be very careful about the order in which you do each step of a function.  It is important that you don't lose bits of the list as you try to add and remove nodes.  The following shows pictorially how insertion and removal could be done.  When you write your own linked list, pictures will help, so draw them to help yourself out.

Note:  In each of the following illustration a code segment will be used to show the code needed to obtain the desired result.  IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE FULL CODE TO A FUNCTION.
