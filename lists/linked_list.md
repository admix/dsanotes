# Linked List

The linked list data structure is made up of multiple nodes.  Each node is made up of two portions, a data portion and a pointer portion.  The data portion contains one instance of the data to be stored.  While the pointer portion indicates the location of another node.

An array of 5 doubles:

![Array of 5 doubles](../assets/list-array.png)

A linked list storing the same data as the above array:

![Linked list of 5 doubles](../assets/list-linked.png)


Each linked list must have a pointer to some node in the list.  Any other node in the list is reached by following the pointers from one node to the next.

Like an array, a linked list stores data of the same data type.  The data type of a linked list will determine how each node is declared.
