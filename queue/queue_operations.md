# Queue Operations
* **enqueue** - adds an item to the end of the queue
* **dequeue** - remove an item from front of the queue
* **initialize** - create an empty queue
* **isEmpty** - tests for whether or not queue is empty
* **isFull** - tests to see if queue is full (not needed if data structure grows automatically)
* **front** - looks at value of the first item but do not remove it
