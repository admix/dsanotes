# Queue Applications

Queues are a useful representation of problems for different applications.  For example, jobs to a network printer is enqueued so that the earlier a job is submitted the earlier it will be printed.  Breadth first searches use queues.  Queues also have applications in graph theory.  Later when we study trees we will make use of a queue to perform a breadth first traversal of a tree.
