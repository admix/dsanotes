# Stack Operations

* **push** - add a new item to the stack (remember always add to front or top)
* **pop** - removes first item from the stack
* **initialize** - create an empty stack
* **isEmpty** - tests for whether or not stack is empty
* **isFull** - tests to see if stack is full and cannot grow (not always needed)
* **top** - looks at value of the top item but do not remove it
