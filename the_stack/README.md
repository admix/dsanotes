# The Stack

A stack is a kind of list where items are always added to the front and removed from the front.  Thus, a stack is a FILO structure.  A stack can be thought of a structure that resembles a stack of trays.  Each time a new piece of data is added to the stack, it is placed on the top.  Each time a piece of data is removed it also must be removed from the top.  Typically only the top item is visible.  You cannot remove something from the middle.
