# Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a sort based on the building and destroying of a binary heap.  The binary heap is an implementation of a priority Queue.  Normally, when you have a Queue, the first value in is the first value out.  However with a priority Queue the value that comes out of the Queue next depends on the priority of that value.

Basic operations on the binary Heap include:
* insert - add an item to the binary heap
* deleteMin - removes the smallest value in the binary heap.

The idea for the Heap sort is this:  put every value in the array into the binary heap, then repeated call deleteMin to remove the smallest value and put it back into the array.
