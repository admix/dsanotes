# Algorithms and Data Structures in C++

Algorithms and Data Structures looks at how data for computer programs can best be represented and processed.  In this course you will learn several standard algorithms and data structures.  Furthermore, we will also look at how you would go about doing a formal analysis of an algorithm.

For those of you who hate math, I'm sorry to say there will be some math in this course.  It is pretty hard to do an analysis of algorithms without involving some math.  If you are having trouble in this area, please do not hesitate to contact me.

In previous courses we have focused our attention on syntactic details.  We learn how the code works and what you can and cannot say in C/C++.  We learn how to access variables with different operators, directly and indirectly.  We have looked at how memory is allocated and de-allocated.  We have looked at how you can use pointers to point at everything.  In this course our focus will shift.  There will be very little new syntax in this course.  This course will instead focus on how you can use the syntax you already know to write code more efficiently.  Although the language of choice in this course is C++, you can just as easily use other languages to implement the algorithms and data structures introduced in this course.  Remember to focus on the algorithms and data structures itself as opposed to the syntax and language details.
